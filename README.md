# -E-commerce-Furniture-Data-Analysis
📝 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of furniture products using Python and data analysis libraries to discover trends, patterns, and insights. The primary goal is to understand how different product attributes—like price and shipping tags—influence the number of items sold.

🎯 Objective
Analyze the number of furniture items sold based on product attributes.

Identify trends and relationships between price and sales volume.

Understand how factors like free shipping affect sales performance.

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Column Name	Description
productTitle	The name of the furniture item
originalPrice	The original price before any discounts
price	The current selling price
sold	The number of units sold
tagText	Additional tags (e.g., "Free shipping")

🔍 Key Insights
📉 Sales vs. Price: A negative relationship exists between price and number of items sold. Lower-priced items tend to sell more.

📦 Shipping Impact: Products with free shipping significantly outperform those with paid shipping in terms of units sold.

📊 Skewed Distributions:

Sales distribution is right-skewed, indicating most products sell in low quantities.

Price distribution is also right-skewed, meaning most orders are placed for lower-priced items.
